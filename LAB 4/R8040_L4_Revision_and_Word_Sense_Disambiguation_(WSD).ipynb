    "**Goal: To analyze multiple meanings (word senses) of open-class words using WordNet, and disambiguate their correct meaning based on context using the Lesk Algorithm. This is useful in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), a key problem in Natural Language Processing.**\n",

    "**1. Collect Sentences from a Magazine/News Article:** We use 4 example sentences: <br>\n",
    "> Sentence 1: The bank will not be open on Sunday. <br>\n",
    "> Sentence 2: He went to the bank of the river to fish. <br>\n",
    "> Sentence 3: The judge sentenced the criminal to five years in prison. <br>\n",
    "> Sentence 4: The stock market crashed due to economic uncertainty. <br>\n",

    "**2. Preprocessing Steps:** Tokenize each sentence into words. <br>\n",
    "> - Get POS tags for each word using nltk.pos_tag. <br>\n",
    "> - Filter only open-class words: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs. <br>\n",
    "> - Map POS tags to WordNet format for accurate sense lookup. <br>\n",

    "**3. Find Word Senses using WordNet:**\n",
    "> - For each open-class word, get all possible meanings (called synsets) from WordNet. <br>\n",

    "**4. Apply the Lesk Algorithm:**\n",
    "> - The Lesk algorithm selects the most likely sense of a word based on overlapping words in the context. <br>\n",
